# World_Weather_Analysis
---
In this analysis I used Google Maps API to find various hotels in cities that have max temperatures between 75 and 90 degrees fahrenheit. After I obtained the results of all the hotels, I had to pick a country to create a vacation itinerary in that had 4 or more hotels. Mexico had multiple results so the vacation itinerary was created there, making 4 stops beginning in Cabo San Lucas.
